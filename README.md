<!-- Building a simple app that combines GoLang and Web3 is a great idea! Here’s a straightforward app concept:

App Concept: Decentralized To-Do List
A decentralized to-do list app where users can store their tasks on a blockchain.

Features:
Task Creation: Users can add tasks, which are stored on a smart contract.
Task Completion: Mark tasks as complete by interacting with the smart contract.
View Tasks: Display all tasks, retrieved from the blockchain, on a web interface.
User Ownership: Only the task creator can modify their tasks. -->


Here's a basic **README.md** file for your decentralized to-do list app:

# Decentralized To-Do List App

## Overview

This is a simple decentralized to-do list application. It allows users to create, view, and manage their tasks using blockchain technology. The backend is built with GoLang, adhering to the Clean Architecture principles, and integrates Web3 for blockchain interaction.

---

## Features

- **Task Creation:** Add tasks to the decentralized storage via a smart contract.
- **Task Completion:** Mark tasks as complete by interacting with the smart contract.
- **View Tasks:** Retrieve and display tasks stored on the blockchain.
- **User Ownership:** Ensure only the task creator can modify their tasks.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** GoLang with Clean Architecture template for microservices.
- **Blockchain:** Smart contracts (to be deployed on Ethereum-compatible blockchain).
- **Web3 Integration:** For interacting with the smart contract.
- **Frontend:** (To be defined - e.g., React, Next.js).
- **Database:** (Optional, depending on additional off-chain requirements).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.20 or higher recommended)
- Node.js and npm for smart contract interactions
- Solidity compiler (e.g., [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/))
- An Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dec-todo-app.git
   cd dec-todo-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```env
   BLOCKCHAIN_URL=<your_blockchain_node_url>
   SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed_contract_address>
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run cmd/main.go
   ```
